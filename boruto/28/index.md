Boruto 28 Summary
=================

Koji infiltrates the leaf village without being dictated
while managing to leave behind Delta. Naruto invites Boruto
for a sparring match. When Boruto loses, Kawaki suggests that
he use Karma. He activates his own Karma to help Boruto with
resonance. With Karma, all of Boruto's attacks are much
more powerful. Naruto is impressed and says they should learn
more about Karma. Kawaki reminisces how he was beaten up in
his younger days by Jigen  and tells Naruto he'd like to do the shadow
clone technique so he can beat himself up. Naruto says he
tried that himself ages ago and that it doesn't help.
The chapter ends with Koji locating Kawaki.
