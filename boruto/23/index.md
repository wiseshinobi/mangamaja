Boruto 23 Summary
=================

Kashin Koji unleashes a sealing jutsu that paralyses Boruto and the others.
Konohamaru is well prepared and is able to release the sealing jutsu.
Konohamaru attacks with a Rasengan, but is taken by surprise when Koji counters
with his own Rasengan. As the two back away after the impact, Koji manages to
sneak in a toad onto Konohamaru, and it bursts into the flames of Samadhi that
can never be extinguished. As the flames are engulfing Konohamaru,
Boruto screams and uses the Karma sign on his hand to dispel the
earlier sealing jutsu and absorb the flames as well. Boruto collapses after
this huge effort. After witnessing Karma in Boruto, Koji decides to back away
without hurting anybody. Sarada attempts to attack him with a Kunai in order to
get more answers, but Mitsuki stops her saying that all that matters is that everyone is safe.
Koji praises Mitsuki for his wisdom and departs. The chapter ends with the team finding
a boy unconscious on the ground. This boy also has karma sign on his hand!
