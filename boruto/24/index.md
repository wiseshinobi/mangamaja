Boruto 24 Summary
=================

Jigen and Delta, two members of Kara, are having dinner. Delta is
concerned about the "vessel", but Jigen says he has confidence in
Kashin Koji. Nevertheless, Jigen permits Delta to check on Kashin Koji
without interfering in his plans. The scene shifts to Boruto and the gang,
and a flashback shows the unconscious boy being traded away by his
guardian to Jigen for some money. Jigen calls the boy Kawaki and says that
from that day on, Jigen will be his father and that his troubles will be
behind him. Kawaki awakens with a burst of energy that forces everyone to back
away and asks Boruto and the others if they were sent by Kara. Jigen and Delta
observe the situation with Kawaki from afar. Konohamaru wants to ask some
questions, but Kawaki is having none of it. Boruto asks Kawaki what the symbol
on his hand (Karma) is. Kawaki, unconvinced of Boruto's friendly intentions,
starts a fire attack against them. Garou, a member of Kara, suddenly appears
and absorbs Kawaki's attack with ninja tech and announces that he will retrieve
the "vessel". Konohamaru figures out that the "vessel" that Kara is after is
actually Kawaki. Garou attacks Kawaki and the battle begins. Kawaki moves really
fast and attacks Garou with new limbs he grows rapidly (like Sasuke's cursed seal), 
but it looks like Kawaki is at a disadvantage because of a recent injury.
