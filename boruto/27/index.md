Boruto 27 Summary
=================

Boruto wakes up in the middle of the night and realizes that he needs to pee!
Kawaki is also up and going towards the bathroom. They argue about who gets
to go first until they realize that the bathroom is already occupied.
They go out into the backyard and pee. Then, they abruptly start fighting
only for Naruto, who was the one taking a dump in the bathroom, to send a
shadow clone to stop Boruto and Kawaki. The next morning, Kawaki asks Boruto
how he got Karma. When Boruto mentions Ootsutsuki, Kawaki realizes that
Boruto really does have nothing to do with Jigen. Kawaki recounts he got Karma.
Out of the several children hanging from the ceiling in the chamber where
Jigen is experimenting to find a "vessel", only Kawaki manages to imbibe
Karma without dying. Kawaki asks Boruto to work with him to get rid of Karma.
Boruto grudgingly agrees, but immediately has a row about breaking the Hinamari's
vase again. Kawaki tells Naruto that he'll get a new vase, but when asked if he
has the money, he calmly says that he'll steal it. Naruto is annoyed but asks
Kawaki to join him.
