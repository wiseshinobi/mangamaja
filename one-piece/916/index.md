One Piece 916 Summary
=====================

Urashima is extremely upset that Kiku cut off his hair and tries to kill her.
Luffy stops him and challenges him to a sumo wrestling match. Hawkins calls
ahead and tells the pirates that they are no match for Luffy and that they
should wait for him to arrive. Luffy uses his palm to throw Urashima out of
the arena and sends him flying. Holdem comes out and says that Luffy's
sumo wrestling match destroyed his home. The lion in his belly has Tama in
its jaws, and Holdem thretens Luffy that he'll chew Tama even if he moves
a muscle. The chapter ends with Hawkins and Law moving quickly to arrive
in Bakura town.
