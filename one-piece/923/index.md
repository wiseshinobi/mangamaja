One Piece 923 Summary
=====================

The chapter begins with Luffy delivering a massive blow to Kaido.
Luffy finds that Speed and Tama were struck down by Kaido as they
were running. An enraged Luffy begins to attack Kaido earnestly.
Law tries to convince Luffy to run away saying that Kaido might
not have noticed them in his dragon form. But Luffy says they're
not even sure if Kinemon and the gang are alright, so they should
fight Kaido right away. Luffy strikes Kaido a few times which forces
Kaido to return to his human form. Luffy uses 4th gear and goes all out
against Kaido. Kaido emerges completely unhurt and ends the battle
with one strong blow that knocks out Luffy!
