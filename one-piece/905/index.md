One Piece 905 Summary
=====================

At the new Marine HQ, Akainu is upset that Fujitora has gone to Mariejois despite his order that Fujitora never come back to the navy until he had Staw Hat's head. Royals from the various kingdoms are arriving at Mariejois for the reverie. Garp is escorting Shirahosi, King Neptune and other fishmen. Stelly, Sabo's adopted brother and now the king of the Goa kingdom in the East Blue, greets Garp only to be called "little shit". Fujitora is chatting with Admiral Ryokugu and says that Vegapunk has built something incredible and that with it, the Shichibukai system can finally be put to an end. Back at the revolutionary army, Koala says that the world government isn't their enemy, rather it's the celestial dragons that control the world govt. At the end of the chapter, it looks like Sabo has infiltrated Mariejois and intends gatecrash the reverie!
