One Piece 921 Summary
=====================

Kinemon informs the gang that the battle will be on the
island of Onigashima. Orochi and the Shogun are expected
to go to the island to offer prayers to Kaido, but in
reality, they'll be drunk. Kiku tells Kinemon that she
met Tsuru already and is aware that she is Kinemon's wife.
Kinemon has created a symbol that'll inform the old
supporters of Oden of the battle and rally them. He assigns
various tasks to each member of the crew that'll help in
attracting a crowd so that they may distribute these signs
to trusted followers of Oden across Wano. In particular,
Kinemon wants to reach out to Kawamatsu, Denjiro, and Boy Ashura.
They were fellow Samurai and will be a big help.
In leftover town, Shutenmaru, the bandit samurai, is ransacking
the town and stealing everything Luffy gave them.
It seems Kaido is interested in recruiting him, but Jack
the pirate begins a fight. Huge clouds suddenly appear in
the sky and a dragon comes out of the clouds. He demands
that straw hat is brought to him immediately. The chapter
ends with Law telling everyone that the dragon is Kaido!
