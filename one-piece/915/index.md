One Piece 915 Summary
=====================

Luffy and the gang arrive at Bakura town. Urashima explains
that he decided to leave leftover town after sening a strong
auro from Zoro. His friend Giftman says that Kiku is a
lower-class girl that he can do whatever he wants with.
Tama is brought to Holdem, a guy with a lion in his belly!
He wants to know how Tama tamed the lion-dog Hihi earlier.
When Tama refuses to show her devil fruit power, he proceeds
to take out part of her cheek with pliers. Urashima is pleased
that Kiku has arrived, but she cuts off his hair and enrages him.
