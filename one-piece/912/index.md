One Piece 912 Summary
=====================

Luffy informs Tama that Ace is dead. Hitetsu is upset at Luffy's lack of tact.
He explains that X-Drake joined Kaido and much of the Wano country has been destroyed.
Only the flower capital where the shogun, Orichi, resides is prosperous.
Tama and the villagers met Ace when his ship landed there 4 years ago.
They tied up the pirates and took all their food. But seeing how hungry
they were, Ace and his crew, despite being more powerful, did not attack the villagers.
Luffy says that he'll take Tama to a doctor. He is given a Kimono so that he doesn't stand out,
but Luffy also grabs a sword, the Nida Kitetsu, one the 21 great swords.
Luffy comes across wild animals and suggests eating them, but Tama says that
they would've drunk poisoned water, so they're poisonous too. As Luffy proceeds
towards the town, he comes across Zoro beating up a bunch of goons!
The chapter ends with Hawkins, a Kaido pirate, challenging Luffy and Zoro.
