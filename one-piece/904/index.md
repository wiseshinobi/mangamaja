One Piece 904 Summary
=====================



The commanders of the revolutionary army are meeting up in Momoiro island ahead of the Reverie. After the events at Big Mom's kingdom, the Germa have been ejected from the World Govt. Sabo is extremely happy after reading the newspaper about Luffy's bounty going up. It looks like the revolutionary leaders are actually meeting to declare war against the celestial dragons!

A pirate named Peachbeard, who claims to be a disciple of Blackbeard, is plundering Lulushia island. The four commanders of the revolutionary army: Morley, Belo Betty, Lindbergh, and Karasu arrive at Lulushia island en route to Momoiro island (where the revolutionaries are meeting). Belo Betty uses her devil fruit power to make the citizens of Lulushia brave, and they attack the pirates and defeat them with a little help from the revolutionary army. The chapter ends with the four revolutionary leaders heading out to meet Monkey D Dragon.
