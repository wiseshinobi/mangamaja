One Piece 924 Summary
=====================

Luffy is out cold from Kaido's blow. Law tries to get Luffy
out but Hawkins arrives and throws seastone nails that
neutralize his powers. Kaido orders Luffy to be thrown in a cell
and starts to walk away. But the unconscious Luffy unleashes
Conqueror's Haki and takes out all of Kaido's underlings.
Kaido walks away saying he'll take care of Law, who has
managed to escape, the next time. Nami and the rest at Oden's castle
were saved by the mature-mature jutsu which aged the rocks
beneath them and created a crator. Franky, Usopp, and Robin read
the newspaper and come to know that Luffy was captured.
As Luffy is brought to his cell, one of the guards tries to pick
on Luffy but ends up dying from a fish bone that was used as a
projectile by one of the inmates. The chapter ends with Luffy
finding himself sharing a cell with Eustass Kid!
