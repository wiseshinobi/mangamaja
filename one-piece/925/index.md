One Piece 925 Summary
=====================

Perona reads the news about Gecko Moria. Mihawk advises
her to go to Moria. Moria is upset that his crewmate,
Absalom, who had the power to go invisible, has been killed
and a member of the blackbear pirates has acquired that
power. Blackbeard exclaims that the revolutionary army
has attacked the Reverie to rescue Kuma, and that Kaido
and the worst generation are in Wano with Big Mom hot on
their tails. In Wano, Inurashi and Ashura fight and call a
truce. Ashura reveals that he was a comrade of Oden and that
he is very upset about the Samurai who abandoned him for 20
years. Tama has recovered from her encounter with Kaido and
says that Umami, the horsewoman, fought fiercely for her sake.
The chapter ends with Jack being ordered by "King" and "Queen"
to get moving (to Wano?).
