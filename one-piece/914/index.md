One Piece 914 Summary
=====================

The village that Tsuru has brought Luffy and the others to is called
Leftover town. Tsuru and Kiku help Tama and Zoro recover. Tsuru offers
a decent meal to a reluctant Tama. Tsuru explains that the place is called
Leftover town because people gather here to scavenge leftovers discarded
by the officials and the bigshots. The Kozuki clan used to rule the Wano
country from Oden castle 20 years ago. Now, the shogun Orichi, now controls
all the edible food on the island. Zoro stops an arrow an inch away from
striking Tsuru. One of the officials from beyond the Torii gate heard
Tusuru badmouthing the shogun and decided to kill her with an arrow.
Gazelleman, one of the henchmen, kidnaps Tama. Luffy and the gang
start to give chase. Kiku says that she is a Samurai and can wield a sword.
The gang are about the gate and enter Bakura town, where officials and
pirates are residing. At a distance, Law learns what Luffy is about the do
and says that they have to stop Luffy from making a scene.
