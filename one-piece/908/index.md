One Piece 908 Summary
=====================

Mjosgard offers to stay with Shirahoshi during the reverie and protect her. Saint Rosward, the father of Saint Charlos who was recently beaten up, is relieved to see his son. He has taken Bartholomew Kuma as a slave and is riding on his back! We also learn that Kuma was previously the king of the Solbay kingdom. Enslaving him seems to be a demonstration that even kings who defy the world government wont be spared. Jewelery Bonney of the worst generation has managed to infiltrate by impersonating the queen of the Solbay kingdom (Or is Bonney the wife or perhaps daughter of Kuma? She does seem distressed by Kuma's enslavement). Sabo is terribly upset about Kuma's fate and wants to attack immediately, but the revolutionaries persuade him to stick to the plan. The reverie begins with a conversation about the deeds of Luffy. Back in the throne room, a shadowy figure appears and pierces a picture of Shirahoshi with a sword and climbs up and sits on the empty throne! It looks like this guy, unknown to almost everyone, is the true king! The gorosei assemble before the throne and ask for the name of the person to be eliminated.
