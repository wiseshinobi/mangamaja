One Piece 927 Summary
=====================

Sanji's food is popular and selling fast when two men
arrive and ask payment for "protection". When Sanji refuses,
the men kick the vessel in which Sanji is cooking and spill
all its contents. The girl waiting to be served is upset that
she couldn't try any of the popular Soba. Sanji beats up the
gangsters and makes them eat the spilled food. He then gives
whatever was left to the kid named Toko. She tells the gang
to come watch the procession of courtesans who are all extremely
pretty. Robin resumes her role as a courtesan and joins the
procession. Lady Komurasaki, the head courtesan is widely
known for her beauty and causes all the nearby men to go crazy.
The chapter ends with Orochi saying that he will have Komurasaki
that night.
