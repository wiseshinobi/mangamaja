One Piece 922 Summary
=====================

Law reasons that Kaido has only come to know about
Luffy's presence on the island and they don't have
any idea about Kinemon's plan of overthrowing Orichi.
Everyone is expecting Kaido to go on a rampage, but
he seems to be drunk and says he'll forget the past
if Shutenmaru joins him as a subordinate. Hawkins
tells Kaido that Luffy and Law are in Oden castle.
This snaps Kaido out of his drunkenness. Hawkins
says he lied but it would still be a good idea to
destroy Oden castle which is serving as a symbol
of hope for the citizens who are expecting the
legend of Orichi's destruction to come true.
Kaido destroys Oden castle is just one shot!
An enraged Luffy uses elephant gun and smacks Kaido
on the head!
