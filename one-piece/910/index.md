One Piece 910 Summary
=====================

The straw hats are reading news on the ship and discover that their old friends Vivi, Dalton, Shirahoshi, etc. are at the reverie (they seem to miss the news about Big Mom going after Luffy). As they approach the Wano country, the weather is terrible and the seas have strong currents. To their surprise, the Straw Hats are surrounded by Koi fish that are usually only found in fresh water. Luffy tries to get one for food, but then they see that the Koi fish are climbing up a water fall! What seems to be the sea is actually a river leading to Wano. Luffy grabs one of the Koi fish and gets the ship to ride up the waterfall and reaches the shore above. However, that last bit of the journey was rough and the ship has capsized. Luffy awakens, seemingly alone, to face two large animals wielding swords.
